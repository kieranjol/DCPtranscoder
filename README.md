# DCPtranscoder
Single Reel script appers to work with SMPTE/INTEROP DCPS if audio is present. <br>
Multi reel currently only works with Interop DCPS with audio<br>

Functional proof of concept, with file open and file save as dialogs! <br>
Tested in Ubuntu and OSX. Should work in windows and if not, why not!? aka I'll test it later. <br>

Future plan: - include the following but allow selection of output codecs.<br>
SMPTE support for multiple reels.
